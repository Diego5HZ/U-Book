Nowadays due to the covid situation there are so many places that need a book appointment before going. How about having a universal application that helps you with a friendly interface to book your appointment? Additionally, in one of the three universal languages, English. 

Just by selecting the country, state/department/province and city and typing what you need you will see the many companies registered with us and if they need to be booked you can do it in our application. If thatâ€™s not enough it will also have a short description(opening/closing hours, about the place, etc.) of the service you are choosing. Finally, you can manage your appointments or plans where you will assist in your profile.
